## Quick Start

JSEncrypt is a tiny (18kb gzip), zero dependency, JavaScript library to perform both synchronous and asynchronous OpenSSL RSA Encryption, Decryption, and Key Generation in both the Browser and Node.js. It's designed to work seamlessly with OpenSSL-generated RSA key pairs, but is also capable of generating new keys (less secure)

### Installation

```bash
npm install jsencrypt
```

### Basic Usage

#### Browser (Script Tag)
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsencrypt/bin/jsencrypt.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Create the encryption object
  const crypt = new JSEncrypt();

  // Here you can either use a private key from OpenSSL, 
  // or generate one using the following code.
  const privateKey = crypt.getPrivateKey();
  
  // Set your RSA private key
  crypt.setPrivateKey(privateKey);
  
  // Encrypt data with the public key
  const encrypted = crypt.encrypt('Hello World!');
  
  // Decrypt data with the private key  
  const decrypted = crypt.decrypt(encrypted);
</script>
```

#### ES6 Module Import
```javascript
import { JSEncrypt } from 'jsencrypt';

// Create the encryption object
const crypt = new JSEncrypt();

// Here you can either use a private key from OpenSSL, 
// or generate one using the following code.
const privateKey = crypt.getPrivateKey();

// Set your RSA private key
crypt.setPrivateKey(privateKey);

// Encrypt data with the public key
const encrypted = crypt.encrypt('Hello World!');

// Decrypt data with the private key  
const decrypted = crypt.decrypt(encrypted);
```

#### Node.js (CommonJS)
```javascript
const JSEncrypt = require('jsencrypt');

// Create the encryption object
const crypt = new JSEncrypt();

// Here you can either use a private key from OpenSSL, 
// or generate one using the following code.
const privateKey = crypt.getPrivateKey();

// Set your RSA private key
crypt.setPrivateKey(privateKey);

// Encrypt data with the public key
const encrypted = crypt.encrypt('Hello World!');

// Decrypt data with the private key  
const decrypted = crypt.decrypt(encrypted);
```

---

## Real-World Example
Here's a complete example showing how to use JSEncrypt with OpenSSL keys:

### 1. Generate RSA Keys with OpenSSL
```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048

# Extract public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
```

### 2. Use in JavaScript

```javascript
import { JSEncrypt } from 'jsencrypt';

// Initialize
const crypt = new JSEncrypt();

// Load your keys
crypt.setPrivateKey(`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEowIBAAKCAQEA...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`);

// Encrypt sensitive data
const originalText = 'Secret message';
const encrypted = crypt.encrypt(originalText);

// Decrypt when needed
const decrypted = crypt.decrypt(encrypted);
console.log(decrypted === originalText); // true
```
